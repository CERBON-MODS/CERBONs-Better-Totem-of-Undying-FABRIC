A highly configurable mod that improves Minecraft Totem of Undying by adding new features to it. You can blacklist dimensions or even structures where you don't want totem to work. The mod also has compatibility with Trinkets.

### New Features 

- Knockback mobs away.
- Save entity from dying in the void.
- Has option to use totem from inventory (Disabled by default).
- If Trinkets mod is installed you can use totem from charm slot.
- Has option to add cooldown to the totem (Disabled by default).
- If you are suffocating totem will break the blocks you are in (You can add blocks to the tag "totem_cant_break" if you want some block to not be break by the totem).
- You can blacklist dimensions where you don't want totem to work.
- You can blacklist structures where you don't want totem to work.
- Increases your food level to 8 if your food level is <= 6 (When you can't run). Note that the hunger bar ranges from 0 to 20.
- Apply Water Breathing effect.
- Apply fire resistance and water breathing effects only when needed, meaning you are going to receive the effects only if you are on fire or in water respectively.

### Config File 

The config file is divided in 4 parts:

- **Minecraft Default Totem Features:** Here is where you can configure things Minecraft does by default with totem, such as giving you regeneration and absorption effects.
- **New Totem Features:** Here is where you can configure all new totem features added by the mod.
- **Trinkets:** Here is where you can configure things related to trinkets integration.
- **Blacklists:** Here is where you can blacklist dimensions or structures.

You need to have [cloth-api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) to edit configs.
